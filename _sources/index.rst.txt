Projector
=========

Projector takes the overhead out of managing your repositories and development environments.

With projector you specify a declarative configuration of your development environments and
the repositories they depend on and the tool takes care of the rest. In the future, Projector
will support easy export and import of development environments so that your colleauges can get
started hacking quickly.
